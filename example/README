These simple scripts are intended as "hello world" type examples of the
Pixel set of extensions.

They are designed to be worked through in the following order:

simple
paste
filters
additive
scale-simple
scale-border
textbutton
textbutton-dropshadow
textbutton-dropshadow-alpha
blur
center
pixiedust

There are far too many aspects of the libs to demo here, consult main.c in
the Pixel sources for a reference of the tcl commands, and 2d.c for details
on the pmap commands
